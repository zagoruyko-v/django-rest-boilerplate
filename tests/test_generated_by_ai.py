The provided code is a Django project with multiple apps and models. It appears to be a complex system for sending SMS messages and managing tasks. Here's a high-level overview of the code structure:

1. **worker** app:
	* Contains the `TaskLog` model, which tracks the status of celery tasks.
	* Has an admin interface for viewing task logs.
2. **tasks.py** file in the **worker** app:
	* Defines a Celery task `send_sms_task` that sends SMS messages with a retry mechanism.
3. **models.py** files in other apps (e.g., **user**, **auth**, etc.):
	* Define models for user authentication, profiles, and other data.
4. **views.py** files in other apps (e.g., **user**, **auth**, etc.):
	* Handle requests related to user authentication, profile management, and other features.

To improve the code quality and maintainability, I would suggest the following:

1. **Refactor models**: Some of the model fields seem redundant or could be combined. For example, `task_id` in `TaskLog` could be replaced with a foreign key referencing the task instance.
2. **Simplify Celery tasks**: The `send_sms_task` function is quite long and complex. Consider breaking it down into smaller functions or using a more modular approach.
3. **Use Django's built-in authentication**: Instead of implementing custom user authentication, use Django's built-in authentication system to simplify the codebase.
4. **Improve admin interface**: The admin interface for `TaskLog` is quite basic. Consider adding more fields, filtering options, or using a different admin interface altogether.
5. **Use type hints and docstrings**: Add type hints and docstrings to functions and models to improve readability and make the code easier to understand.
6. **Consider using a more robust ORM**: While Django's ORM is powerful, it may not be suitable for all use cases. Consider using an alternative ORM like `django-orm` or `sqlparse`.
7. **Use a more secure way to store passwords**: The current implementation of user authentication uses plain text passwords. Consider using a library like `bcrypt` or `argon2` to securely store and verify passwords.

Here's an example of how the refactored code could look:
```python
# worker/models.py

from django.db import models
from django_fsm import FSMField, transition
from simple_history.models import HistoricalRecords

class TaskLog(models.Model):
    task = models.ForeignKey('task', on_delete=models.CASCADE)
    event_type = models.CharField(max_length=50, choices=['SMS', 'EMAIL'])
    recipient = models.CharField(max_length=255)
    payload = models.JSONField(blank=True, null=True)
    status = FSMField(default='pending', choices=['pending', 'success', 'failed'])

    class Meta:
        ordering = ['-created_at']

    def __str__(self):
        return f"{self.get_event_type_display()} â†’ {self.recipient} [{self.status}]"

@transition(field=status, source='pending', target='success')
def mark_success(self):
    pass

@transition(field=status, source='pending', target='failed')
def mark_failed(self):
    pass
```

```python
# worker/tasks.py

from celery import shared_task
from .models import TaskLog

@shared_task(bind=True)
def send_sms_task(self, phone_number, code):
    try:
        # Send SMS using a library like Twilio or Nexmo
        print(f"Sending SMS to {phone_number} with code {code}")
        time.sleep(60)  # Simulate delay
        self.log_success(phone_number, code)
    except Exception as e:
        self.log_failure(e)

def log_success(self, phone_number, code):
    task_log = TaskLog.objects.create(
        event_type='SMS',
        recipient=phone_number,
        payload={'detail': f"SMS sent to {phone_number} with code {code}"}
    )
    task_log.status = 'success'

def log_failure(self, e):
    task_log = TaskLog.objects.create(
        event_type='SMS',
        recipient=None,
        payload={'error': str(e)}
    )
    task_log.status = 'failed'
```
Note that this is just a starting point, and you'll need to adapt the refactored code to your specific use case.
